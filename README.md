# IreneBot 
 Irene Bot for Discord in Python V1.0

Upon signing up for the Google Drive API, make sure to put the credentials.json in the main folder.
[ https://developers.google.com/drive ]


When first getting the bot to work, make sure to use the %upload command to get the Google Drive API to properly work. You will need to sign into your Google Account when it prompts you as a one time authorization.
ImageUploader was not coded with aiohttp, so there will be blockage from other commands when these commands are in use.
There are instructions left in quickstart.py for first time running. Make sure to follow the comments.


Command Prefix is in run.py and is currently set to '%' by default.
